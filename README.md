## About

*"It's not who we are underneath, but what we do that defines us." - Rachel Dawes from Batman Begins*

We are a group of researchers from [Computer Vision and Machine Learning Lab](http://csvision.swansea.ac.uk/) with specific interests in theoretical machine learning and general artificial intelligence ranging from theory, through to methodology and applications in biomedical science. We focus on studying learning robustness including privacy and security aspects, generative learning using probabilistic graphical models with minimum supervision, and learning theory facilitated from stochastics analysis in both continuous and discrete forms, differential geometry and statistical physics. Our routine research activities can be found in our [wiki](../../wiki) page.
