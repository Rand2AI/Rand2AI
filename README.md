# Rand2AI Team

We are a group of enthusiastic researchers from [VIViD](https://vivid.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) group at Durham University, and [SwanseaVision Group](http://csvision.swansea.ac.uk/) based at Swansea University, with common interests in general machine learning and artificial intelligence ranging from theory through methodology to application in biomedical science. We focus on studying robustness of machine learning models including privacy and security properties, generative learning using probabilistic graphical models with minimum supervision, and learning theories facilitated from stochastics analysis, differential geometry and statistical physics. More information can be found on our [Wikipedia](../../wiki) page.
