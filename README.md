## About

*"It's not who we are underneath, but what we do that defines us." - Rachel Dawes from Batman Begins*

We are a group of researchers from [Perception Lab](https://perception-lab.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) based at Durham and [Computer Vision and Machine Learning Lab](http://csvision.swansea.ac.uk/) based at Swansea with common interests in general machine learning and artificial intelligence ranging from theory through methodology to application in biomedical science. We focus on studying learning robustness including privacy and security properties, generative learning using probabilistic graphical models with minimum supervision, and learning theories facilitated from stochastics analysis differential geometry and statistical physics. Our routine research activities can be found in our [wiki](../../wiki) page.
